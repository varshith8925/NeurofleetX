Project Statement:
NeuroFleetX is a next-generation AI-driven platform designed to optimize urban
mobility and fleet operations for rental, transport, and smart city use cases. By
leveraging artificial intelligence, IoT, and geospatial data, NeuroFleetX enables realtime vehicle tracking, intelligent routing, predictive maintenance, dynamic fleet
allocation, and customer-centric service models.
The system integrates machine learning models to predict traffic conditions, optimize
route plans, and monitor vehicle health. It also employs advanced dashboards and
mobile-first interfaces for fleet managers and end-users. Designed for scalability,
NeuroFleetX can be adapted for electric vehicle (EV) fleets, ride-sharing models, or
multi-modal transport networks, offering both operational efficiency and sustainable
mobility solutions for modern cities.
